# NeuroData Design

This should be the best class you ever take! That's because it will be what you make of it, and you are awesome.
More specifically, what i expect to happen is the following
- over the course of a year (yes, both semester's are required), you will design and build a neurodata web- and/or mobile-app
- you will do so with a team that you select of 3-4 undergrads
- we will meet every week with the other teams, each week you will both:
   - report on progress from the previous week, demonstrating having achieving the "definition of done" for each of the previous weeks objectives
   - make a plan of "X will do Y to achieve Z by T", where T includes next week, and possibly future weeks
- you will have a detailed design doc NLT 8 weeks in
- at the end of the year, your app will be live and operational
